# First_Principles
Tired of being a copy-paste dev. Relearning computer programming, software engineering, and interacting with hardware with an anti-copy-paste/anti-AI approach, using physical books and Linux man-pages only. No AI-tools, no Stackoverflow, no online search engine.

Due to the anti-copy paste/ anti-AI approach, along with my poverty of talent, beware that the code in this repository might be of terrible quality.
