Implementing a client for getting interest rate data from Riksbank and do some analysis in C/C++, in order to learn how API calls work under the hood :)

Usage:
- Preconditions: linux machine with openssl and gcc compiler available
- compile: g++ -o interest_rates riksbank_client.cpp -lssl
- execute program: ./interest_rates
